# authenticationapi
Authentication API implemented in Node.js.

## Original idea
The original idea was to follow the next steps:
* Use **[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io)** to generate the data model
* Use **[sequelize-auto](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-auto)** to generate the models for the Sequelize ORM.
* Implement the API using **[Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)**
* Generate the API docs with **[Swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express)**
* Import the API docs in **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** and generate a client for the API

## Results
I was able to stick to the plan and the results speak for themselves.
